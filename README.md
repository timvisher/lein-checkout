# lein-checkout

A Leiningen plugin to manage your checkouts without setting your hair on fire.

## Usage

Put `[org.clojars.timvisher/lein-checkout "0.4.2"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
lein-checkout 0.4.2`.

`checkout` follows [Semantic Versioning][semver]

`checkout` reads the `:dependencies` key out of your `project.clj` and then searches for those projects to create a checkout for them in a configurable manner. It allows you to do several other things with your checkouts as well.

By default, `checkout` searches the parent directory of the current project for projects. If you need fancier logic than that (i.e. you store your projects across multiple directory trees), you'll need to specify configuration similar to the following:
    
    :checkout {:search-roots ["/path/containing/projects"]}
    
This `:checkout` config would be placed in your `project.clj` (for project by project configuration), or in your `:user` profile (for system wide configuration). The vector of paths are the absolute paths of directories which house your projects so that `checkout` can search there as well.

If your project tree looks like this

    .   
    `-- projects
        |-- a
        |-- b
        `-- c

And you're currently in project `a`, adding a checkout to project `b` would look like:

    $ lein checkout [ln] b

Adding a checkout to all projects would be:

    $ lein checkout [ln]

`PATTERN` arguments are passed directly to `re-matches`.

Keep in mind that `b` must be specified as a dependency of `a` or `checkout` will not find it. Why are you trying to create a checkout to a non-depedency?

Other tasks include:

    rm        [pattern]: Remove all checkouts. If PATTERN is specified, only checkouts matching that pattern will be removed
    enable    Enable checkouts.
    disable   Disable all checkouts for a moment.
    list      List checkouts.
